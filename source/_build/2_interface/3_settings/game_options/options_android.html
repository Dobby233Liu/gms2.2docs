<h2>Android Options</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">
<p><br>
</p>

<p>This section outlines the different options available to you
that control how your Android game projects will be compiled. The
different sections are:</p>

<blockquote><label class="collapse" for="a">General</label>
<input id="a" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p><img class="center" src="images/android_general1_options.png"
alt="Android General Options Part 1">
</p>

<p>The first part of the <b>General</b> section is dedicated to the
<i>Product Information</i> and the <i>Build Settings</i>. You
should fill in the Product information, which includes the projects
<i>Display Name</i>, its <i>Package information</i>, which consists
of a Domain, Company and Product. The package information can only
be made up of letters from A-Z and numbers 0-9, with no symbols or
other special characters at all, nor should it have uppercase
characters. These details will then be used to generate a Package
ID with the format "<tt>com.company.myappname</tt>".</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: If you have already set up the
<b>Amazon Fire</b> Game Options, you can click the "Sync from
Amazon Fire" button at the top to transfer the relevant information
from the Fire options to the Android options.</div>

<p><br>
You then need to set the <b>Build Tools</b> as well as the
<b>Target</b>, <b>Minimum</b> and <b>Compile</b> SDK versions.</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: There is also an option for the
"Support Library" version to use. From GameMaker Studio v2.2.4 and
above, this is no longer required and any values used here will be
ignored. The setting is maintained for use with legacy projects
that require an earlier runtime than 2.2.4.</div>

<p><br>
The <b>Build Tools</b> (and <b>Support Library</b> if required) are
used when <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> builds your game for the
Android target and should be set to appropriate values based on the
tools you have installed using Android Studio.</p>

<p>The <b>Target SDK</b> indicates that you have tested your app on
(up to and including) the version you specify here. This is simply
to give the Android OS an idea of how it should handle your app in
terms of OS features. For all practical purposes, most apps are
going to want to set Target SDK to the latest released version of
the API (as used by the Compile SDK setting). This will ensure your
app looks as good as possible on the most recent Android devices.
Note that from November 2019 Google has made API level 28 the
required target.</p>

<p>The <b>Minimum SDK</b> version is the minimum API level that
will run your project. From November 2019 Google has made API level
16 the absolute minimum required, but if you add extensions then
they may require a higher minimum API level.</p>

<p>The <b>Compile SDK</b> version is the version of the API that
the project is compiled against. This means you can use Android API
features included in that version of the API. If you try and use
API 16 features - for example - but set Compile SDK 15, then you
will get a compilation error. However, if you set the Compile SDK
to 28 then you can still run the app on an API 26 device (as well
as all other previous versions too).</p>

<p>You can select from one of the predefined target settings by
clicking on the <b>Pre-populate SDK values to chosen API level</b>
button, which will open a list of different APIs to choose from.
Selecting any one of them will populate all the SDK files with
appropriate values which you can then use or edit as required.</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: You must have installed the
appropriate APIs in the Android SDK Manager or through Android
Studio for your projects to compile correctly.</div>
<br>
<img class="center" src="images/android_general2_options.png" alt=
"Android General Options Part 2">
<p>The second part of the <b>General</b> section covers the CPU
<i>Architectures</i> to build for, with the following options
available (you can select all of them or only those that you
require, but note that each one will add to the final size of the
compiled <tt>apk</tt>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Build for ARMV5 (checked by default)</li>

<li>Build for ARMV7 (Checked by default)</li>

<li>Build for x86 (checked by default)</li>

<li>Build for Mips (checked by default)</li>

<li>Build for ARM64</li>

<li>Build for x86_64</li>
</ul>

<p>After setting that up you can select the different
<i>Orientations</i> that your game can be run on for the best user
experience. The available options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Landscape</li>

<li>Portrait</li>

<li>Landscape-flipped</li>

<li>Portrait-flipped</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally you have the following miscellaneous options:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Enable Bluetooth/iCade support</b>: This will add support
for bluetooth or iCade gamepads to your game project. This is on by
default.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Enable MOGA gamepad support</b>: This will enable support
for MOGA controllers. Note that all MOGA functionality is accessed
via an extension, and when you first check this option you will be
prompted to download and install the MOGA extension from the
Marketplace. This option is off by default.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Run Lint Code Analysis</b>: When this option is flagged, the
build tools will run a lint code analysis on the project as it
builds, giving a more in-depth error check and showing more
information in the output window as the project compiles (a LOG
file will be created too, with the path to the file shown at the
end of compiling in the Output Window). Note that not everything
flagged by lint analysis as an error is necessarily problematic for
your game, and having this enabled may mean that your game no
longer compiles, even though when it is off, it will compile and
run fine. Essentially this is only for debugging, and the option is
off by default.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Install Location</b>: Here you can set the default Install
Location for your game. This can either be set to <i>Automatic</i>,
in which case the game will be installed to the location chosen by
the user on their device, or it can be set to <i>Prefer
External</i> which will always try to install the game to the
external storage of the device.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also set the Android <b>Sleep Margin</b> here. This
option is related to reducing stuttering when running your game on
specific systems. Basically, if your game is running faster than
your room speed <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> will "sleep" for the
remaining time, but this sleep can be quite inaccurate and you can
often end of sleeping for longer than necessary, causing your frame
to take longer which causes stuttering. To get around this we can
sleep for less time, then sit in a tight loop for the remainder of
the time to make it more accurate - although the problem with
sitting in a loop is that it causes CPU usage to increase, which in
turn can cause your CPU temperatures to rise and your device to use
more battery. By default, this value is set to 4, and in 99.99% of
the cases you'll be fine with this, but for low end devices or for
devices with a lot of background processes running this may not be
an ideal solution and a value of 5 up to 10 may be required. Note
though that this is very much a device specific configuration and
what works on your build device may not be appropriate for another
user, and as such if in doubt leave it set to 4.</p>
</div>
<br>
<label class="collapse" for="g">Adaptive Icons</label> <input id=
"g" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p><img class="center" src=
"images/android_adaptiveicons_options.png" alt=
"Android Adaptive Icons Options">
</p>

<p>Android 8.0 (API level 26) introduced <b>adaptive launcher
icons</b> for your games, and these icons can display a variety of
shapes across different device models. To deal with this, you are
required to supply a number of foreground and background images for
your icons to be displayed at different sizes. These icon sizes
are:</p>

<ul>
<li>81x81 pixels (LDPI)</li>

<li>108x108 pixels MDPI)</li>

<li>162x162 pixels (HDPI)</li>

<li>216x216 pixels (XHDPI)</li>

<li>324x324 pixels (XXHDPI)</li>

<li>432x432 pixels (XXXHDPI)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can supply each forground and background image individually,
or you can choose to <b>Generate Icons From File</b>. This means
that <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> will generate the required icon
images from a base (XXXHDPI) file. You need to supply one image
each for the foreground and background and then click the button
labeled <b>Generate</b>, and the Icons will be created for you.</p>

<p>Note that your adaptive icons may be <i>masked</i> on any given
device and so you also have the option to see how they'll look
along with these masks from the <b>Preview Adaptive Icons</b>
menu:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="images/android_adaptiveicons_masks.gif"
alt="Android Adaptive Mask Preview">
</p>

<p>Note that this is simply a preview of how the icon could look
with the selected mask, and the setting will <i>not</i> affect how
the icons are exported and displayed, as that is up to the device
and OS the game will be run on.</p>
</div>
<br>
<label class="collapse" for="b">Graphics</label> <input id="b"
type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p><img class="center" src="images/android_graphics_options.png"
alt="Android Graphics Options">
</p>

<p>Here you can change the following details related to how your
game will be displayed, with the following options available:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Interpolate colours between pixels</b>: Turns on
interpolation, which basically "smooths" pixels. for crisp pixel
graphics, it should be off, but if you have nice alpha blends and
smoothed edge graphics it is better left on. Default is off.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Screen Colour Depth</b>: This can be used to set the colour
depth for rendering to either 16bit or 24bit. This will affect the
compatibility with some older devices if it is set to 24bit, and
will also increase the <i>ashmem</i> that is needed (this is the
shared memory on Android devices).<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Device Support</b> This option will set whether to support
only devices that have a dedicated GPU, or all devices. Basically,
if your game has any advanced drawing functions like alpha
blending, additive blending, surfaces, etc... you should limit it
to those devices that have a GPU otherwise you run the risk of
getting negative comments and poor rating for your game due to
graphical errors or crashes on older devices.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Scaling</b>: Here you can select to scale the draw canvas
maintaining the aspect ratio within the device screen - adding
"padding" around the edges to fit the screen - or you can select to
have the draw canvas stretched stretch to fit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally there is the option to set the size of the <b>Texture
Page</b>. The default (and most compatible) size is 2048x2048, but
you can choose from anywhere between 256x256 up to 4096x4096. There
is also a button marked <i>Preview</i> which will generate the
texture pages for this platform and then open a window so that you
can see how they look. This can be very useful if you wish to see
how the texture pages are structured and to prevent having texture
pages larger (or smaller) than necessary.</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: Be aware that the larger the size of
the texture page, the less compatible your game will be.</div>
</div>
<br>
<label class="collapse" for="g">Icons</label> <input id="g" type=
"checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p><img class="center" src="images/android_icons_options.png" alt=
"Android Icons Options">
</p>

<p>This section permits you to add the various icon images that
your project will need for the different store pages and devices.
All icon images should be created as 24bit PNG files of the
appropriate sizes given.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> has a <a href=
"../../2_extras/project_image_generator.html">Project Image
Generator</a> tool which can be used to automatically create all
the icons required for all the different target platforms your game
is being compiled to. If you use this tool, you should revise the
images created to ensure that they are what you require.</p>
</div>
<br>
<label class="collapse" for="c">Images</label> <input id="c" type=
"checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p><img class="center" src="images/android_images_options.png" alt=
"Android Images Options">
</p>

<p>Here you can add a splash screen to your final game file, for
both landscape and portrait modes, which will be shown while the
game loads on the device. This screen should be a 24bit PNG file,
and is recommended to be the same size as the first room (or view)
of your game. If you require that the splash screen be shown for a
specific time then you can also set it here from 0 to 10 seconds
(the default time of 0 means that it will only show for the
duration of the asset loading).</p>

<div class="note"><b>IMPORTANT!</b> On very old and very low end
devices, a splash screen greater than 1024x768 may cause an out of
memory error.</div>

<p><br>
It is worth noting that <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> has a <a href=
"../../2_extras/project_image_generator.html">Project Image
Generator</a> tool which can be used to automatically create all
the images required for all the different target platforms your
game is being compiled to. If you use this tool, you should revise

type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p><img class="center" src="images/android_packaging_options.png"
alt="Android Packaging Options">
</p>

<p>One of the features of using Google Play for your Android games
is the ability to licence your games. This means that your games
will be controlled by Google so that only people that have
downloaded it through their market will be able to play the game,
thus avoiding illegal copies of your product from getting
distributed.</p>

<p>To activate this function in your game, you must first flag the
<b>Enable Google Licensing</b> box and then copy your <b>Public
Key</b> into the box labelled <b>Google Licencing Public Key</b>.
This licence can be found by going to your <a href=
"https://play.google.com/apps/publish" target="_blank">Google Play
Developers Page</a> and then selecting the game you wish to edit.
Once on the game profile page, scroll down to the section titled
"Services &amp; APIs" and there you should find the Public key that
is needed for this functionality to be enabled.</p>

<p>Once activated, if anyone who is not authorised to posses your
game tries to play it, they will be shown a pop-up message box that
will inform them that the Licence cannot be found on their device,
and then give them the option to retry and test again, or exit the
game.</p>

<p>Another feature of Licensing is that your game can then use
<b>APK Expansions</b>. This is a way to bypass the 50MB maximum
application size imposed by Google Play (and only Google Play). It
will create your game in two parts: a small <tt>*.apk</tt> file and
a larger <tt>*.zip</tt> file which will hold all your games assets,
both of which are uploaded to the store. When the user first runs
your game, the zip will be downloaded and unpacked. You can find
further details of this option <a href=
"http://help.yoyogames.com/entries/28291426" target=
"_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, you have the option to prepare the final app package as
an <b>Android TV</b> game (you should only tick this if your game
conforms to the <a href=
"https://developer.android.com/training/tv/games/" target=
"_blank">Android TV guidelines</a>).</p>
</div>
<br>
<label class="collapse" for="e">Permissions</label> <input id="e"
type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p><img class="center" src="images/android_permissions_options.png"
alt="Android Permissions Options">
</p>

<p>From this tab you can change some of the permissions that your
game may request within the Android Manifest. <i>GameMaker Studio
2</i> will allocate permissions automatically as required, however
you may find you require a permission for your game that hasn't
been correctly assigned (for example, when you use custom
extensions) in which case tick the requisite permission box. The
list below outlines those that are available:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</b>: Will permit your game to write
to external storage.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>READ_PHONE_STATE</b>: Allow read only access to the phone
state.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</b>: Permit your game to access
information about networks.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>INTERNET</b>: Permit your game to open network sockets.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>BLUETOOTH</b>: Will permit your game to connect to paired
Bluetooth devices.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>RECORD AUDIO</b>: Will permit your game to record audio
input from the microphone.<br>
<br></li>
</ul>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: If you are not sure that you need
these, you should probably just leave them un-checked by default
and let <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> deal with the permissions for
your game.</div>

<p><br>
The Android Permissions secton also has an area where you can
inject permissions into the Android Application Tags in the
<tt>Androidmanifest.xml</tt>. You can find a full list of available
tags from the Android documentation here: <a href=
"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element"
target="_blank">Android Developer: Application Tags</a>. It is
worth noting that for target API 28 and above, you will no longer
be permitted to use any external web calls using "http" ("https" is
required instead) unless you add the following tag:</p>

<p class="code">android:usesCleartextTraffic = "true"</p>
</div>
<br>
<label class="collapse" for="f">Social</label> <input id="f" type=
"checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p><img class="center" src="images/android_social_options.png" alt=
"Android Social Options">
</p>

<p>This section is for enabling different <b>Social</b> features in
your Android game. The following options can be chosen:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Facebook</b>: If you require the Facebook functions, you
need to select this checkbox and then supply the <b>Facebook App
ID</b> and <b>Facebook App Name</b>. Note that all Facebook
functionality is accessed via an extension, and when you first
check the <b>Use Facebook</b> box you will be prompted to download
and install the Facebook extension from the Marketplace.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Google - Enable Push Notifications</b>: In order for your
game to use <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/asynchronous%20functions/index.html">
Push Notifications</a> they must be enabled here first otherwise
they will not work. Local notifications on Android do not require
the "GCM Sender ID", but you must add it should you wish to create
remote notifications.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Google - Enable Google Services</b>: If you want to enable
achievements and leader boards for the Google app store, then you
need to check the <b>Enable Google Services</b> checkbox. Once you
have selected this you will be prompted to download and install the
corresponding extension from the Marketplace, and then code the
functionality into your game using the extension boards functions.
Note that if you use Google Play you will need to add your App Id
into this tab for the services to work (this can be found from your
Google Play Developers dashboard).<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Google - Enable Cloud Saving</b>: Checking this will enable
Google Cloud Saving, and (as above) will prompt you to download and
install the relevant extension from the Marketplace. See the
section on Cloud Saving from the <a href=
"../../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/asynchronous%20functions/index.html">
Asynchronous Functions</a> page.<br>
