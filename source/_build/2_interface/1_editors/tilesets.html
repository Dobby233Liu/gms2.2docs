"Tile Set Editor"> A tile set is a graphic resource for drawing
levels and other static components of your game. A tile set is
comprised of a single image that is then split into different
"cells" (tiles), and each tile can be place into the room editor to
create a complete image. Below you can see two example sprites that
can be used as tile sets: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_tilesets_example.png" alt="Tile Set Example"></p>

<div class="note" style="text-align:center;">Images by <a href=
"http://www.lostgarden.com/2006/07/more-free-game-graphics.html"
target="_blank">Lost Garden</a></div>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>These are the most common ways that people create tile sets -
either all jammed up together or with little spaces separating them
out, and <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> can handle both types.
Essentially all tilesets must be comprised of images that fit
within a clearly defined grid, with each cell of the grid being the
exact same size (note that while the images shown above are all
made up of square tiles, a tile set can be made from rectangular
tiles too). When creating your tilesets, keep in mind that the top
left grid cell must <i>always</i> be empty as this is the tile that
<i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> will use for "empty" tiles in a room and
for erasing existing tiles (and even if you have pixels in that
part of the image they will be ignored).</p>

<p>When you first create a tile set resource the tile set editor
window will open with the following options:</p>

<blockquote><a name="tileset_name" id="tileset_name"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="one">Name</label> <input id="one"
type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>Here you can give a name to your tile set. Names can only be
alpha-numeric and may only use the underbar "_" symbol, and they
cannot start with a number.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="tileset_sprite" id="tileset_sprite"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="two">Sprite</label> <input id="two" type=
"checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>Here you can select the sprite resource from which to create our
tile set. Clicking on the main button will open the <b>Asset
Explorer</b> where you can choose the sprite you wish to use for
the tile set: <img class="center" src=
"../../1_overview/2_quick_start/images/qs_assetexplorer.png" alt=
"The Asset Explorer Window"></p>

<p>You can also click on the <b>New Sprite</b> button <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_newsprite.png"> button to
create a new sprite resource (which will open the Sprite Editor for
the new resource within the workspace for editing), or you can edit
the currently selected sprite using the <b>Edit Sprite</b> button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_editsprite.png">, or even choose to edit the sprite
image itself in the Image Editor by pressing the <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_editimage.png">
button.</p>

<p>By default when you open a tile set the Tile Set Properties
window will also be shown (see below), but if you close it then you
can click the button here to reopen it again.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="tileset_properties" id="tileset_properties"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="three">Properties</label> <input id=
"three" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The Tile Set Properties window is for designating the base tile
size (default is 16px square), the offset amount and the separation
between tiles (these last two options are for use with sprites like
the one shown above where there are gaps between the individual
parts of the tiles). You can also set the <b>Output Border</b>
values for the tile set image, which controls how the image will be
stored on disk and add extra pixels around each tile as
required.</p>

<p>Due to how tiles are rendered they need to be prepared
beforehand with a border around each one to "smear" the edges. The
image shown below illustrates how tiles are generally mapped by the
device graphic drivers, with the red line around the tile showing
where the U,V coordinates are mapped to (The letters "U" and "V"
are used to describe the 2D texture mesh because "X", "Y" and "Z"
are already used to describe room and object spatial coordinates):
<img class="center" src="images/editor_tilesets_single.png" alt=
"Single Tile"></p>

<p>As you can see it picks the center of the texel (a texel is just
a pixel in a texture map) to map directly when drawing the image in
the room. Now at a scale of 1:1, this is all well and good, but
what will happen when we scale this tile down? The issue with
scaling down is that when you shrink, the UVs also scale down and
try to fit into a more compressed space, but this obviously can't
happen, so the graphics driver picks which texels to draw based on
the available pixel centers. So, if we are "just" moving into a new
screen pixel then, because the graphics drivers use the center of
the pixel to decide what to draw with, it'll pick a texel
<i>surrounding</i> the tile, not a texel <i>on</i> the tile itself.
<img class="center" src="images/editor_tilesets_texel.png" alt=
"Texel Tile"></p>

<p>Shown above is a tile being draw scaled down into 6 screen
pixels, and this shows that when you overlap a little into the next
screen pixel, the graphics driver has to make a choice to either
drop that texel, or it try and fill it with what it thinks is a
valid texel. Let's just say that in this case it decides to draw
the overlapped texel into the screen pixel, and, since it's now
clearly outside our tile it gets this pixel from either the next
tile, or the little bits of space you provided around the tiles,
which means that when it shrinks you'll get cracks between tiles
"glitches" in how they are drawn and this is where a lot of
confusion arises... Each graphics driver and device actually does
this in its own way, meaning that the results can be unpredictable
and look terrible... but if you're careful and plan ahead you can
work around it.</p>

<p>With high end games if you draw from a single texture (not on a
texture page or texture atlas), you have the option of using a
texture mode called clamp and what this does is repeats the last
row of texels infinitely off into the distance, allowing you to
scale without problems as it forces the hardware to get the last
row of pixels no matter what. This is what the <b>Output Border</b>
settings here do for you: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_tilesets_smear.png" alt="Smear Tile"></p>

<p>Shown above is a "fixed" tile sprite and you can see it now has
a repeated section around each tile meaning that when the hardware
overruns, it will always pick the last texel from the tile rather
than one of the spaces or the tile after that. So, when creating a
tile set, keep in mind that if you are going to be zooming the game
view in or out or are going to be rendering the tiles scaled, you
may need to have a higher <b>Output Border</b> width or height than
the default value of 2.</p>

<p>The final option in the tile set properties is <b>Disable Source
Sprite Export</b>. This is checked by default, and what it does is
flags the source sprite resource to be omitted when the texture
page for your project is being generated. This works under the
assumption that a sprite used as a tile set will not be getting
used for anything else, and so only needs to be exported once.
However if you are using the base sprite resource for anything
other than tiles, then you would want to un-check this so that the
base sprite <i>and</i> the tile set are both added into the texture
page on compile.</p>

<p>Each of the buttons in the <b>Editors</b> section will open a
different editor for specific tile set functionality. You can
create tile set brushes based on multiple tiles together, animated
tiles, using different tiles as individual frames, and you can also
create auto-tiles that will "join" together based on the tiles that
surround them. Each of these editors is explained in detail
below.</p>

<h2>Tile Set Editors</h2>

<p>Once you have set up the basic properties for your tile set in
the main editor, you can open any one of three other editors to add
further tile set information. Each editor corresponds to a
different functionality, but all are based on the current image
selected for the tile set. So, you can have a single large tile set
and in it incorporate your auto-tiles and animated tiles, etc...
The sections below explain each of the editors in detail:</p>

<blockquote><a name="tilemap_brushes" id="tilemap_brushes"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="nine">Brush Builder</label> <input id=
"nine" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>By default when you "paint" tiles onto a tilemap layer in the
room editor, you select a single tile and paint with that. However,
tilesets are almost always designed to have sections that fit
together in different ways to form whole sections. For example, an
RPG tile set may have landscape feature tiles that can be connected
to create larger or smaller features depending on the number of
tiles used. Now, placing multiple features like this on a room
layer would require you to go back and forth many times to change
tile, which is not good for your workflow. To resolve this, we have
added tile <b>Brushes</b> to the tile set editor, available when
you click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on the <i>Brush Builder</i> button:
<img class="center" src="images/03_01_brushes.png" alt=
"Brushes"></p>

<p>In the <b>Brush Builder</b> you have the original tile set on
the left and a blank "canvas" on the right. You can now select any
tile from the left and paint it on the right to create custom
"brushes" which you can then use in the room editor. Note that you
can click and hold the left mouse button <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> then drag
on the tile set to select multiple tiles to paint into the brush
canvas and you can also hold down <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png">/<img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_cmd.png"> + <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> to add
specific individual tiles or hold down <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_alt.png"> +
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png">
to remove specific tiles. The following image shows our previously
mentioned landscape features as an example of three custom brushes
made from a single tile set: <img class="center" src=
"images/03_02_featuresbrushes.png" alt=
"Features As Brushes Example"></p>

<p>On the right you can see three features that we've made
(highlighted orange in the image). Notice how we've left a gap of
one tile between each feature - this is because <i><b>any touching
group of tiles will be treated as a single brush in the room
editor</b></i>, so we leave a gap of one tile to show that each set
is a distinct brush we want to create. While creating your brushes,
you paint with the left mouse button <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> and delete
with the right mouse button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_rmb.png">. You can also zoom the tile sheet or
the brush canvas using <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png">/<img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_cmd.png"> and the mouse wheel <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_mmb.png"> when the
mouse is over one of the windows, or you can pan around using
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png">
+ <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_space.png"> or the middle mouse button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_mmb.png">. Note that you can also use the
preview tools within the editor windows to change the zoom levels
of either window.</p>

<p>At the top right you can see the currently selected tool, and
you can also set the <i>size</i> of the brush that you want to
paint with. The default size is 1, which is a single tile, but if
you set it to higher values then you can paint (and erase) with a
larger brush composed of the selected tile repeated, as shown in
the image below: <img class="center" src="images/tile_size.gif"
alt="Tile Size Animation"></p>

<p>The <b>toolbox</b> is where you can select the tool to use for
many different tasks in the tile set editor, some of which will
depend on whether you have anything defined in your autotile
library. A brief outline of each tool is given below (note that
when you have selected a tile layer in the <a href=
"rooms.html#room_tile_layer">Room Editor</a>, then this toolbox is
displayed at the top of the room workspace):</p>

<p>Below the tools, you can find two different sections for
selecting any autotile or animated tiles that have been created
using the current tile set image. A single sprite that is used for
a tile set can have many, many, single cell images in it, and these
can be combined in the Animation or Autotile editor to create
custom brushes which will show up in these sections and can be used
in conjunction with regular static tiles to create brushes (note
that an animated tile will animate regardless of whether you have
selected it from the library or from the base tile set).</p>

<p>Once you have set up all the brushes you require, you can then
use them to paint tiles onto any tilemap layer within the room
editor.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="tileset_animated" id="tileset_animated"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="ten">Animation</label> <input id="ten" type=
"checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>Tiles are generally considered to be static cells within the
game room, however with <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> it is possible to
animate them, just as you would a sprite. Why not just use sprites,
you ask? Well, sprites have a certain processing overhead due to
them being associated with a bounding box and the way in which they
are rendered, but tiles have a much lower processing overhead and
so are faster to render. This does come at a price however, in that
with tile set animations you are limited to creating animations
that <i>must be a power of two in length</i> - ie: of 2, 4, 8, 16,
etc... frames - and they must obviously be created within the tile
grid, and they must all animate at the same speed (on a per-tile
set basis). However, even with these limitations, animated tiles
are a powerful feature that can be used to add life and colour to
otherwise static environments and backgrounds.</p>

<p>To create a tile animation you must first have a tile set that
has the required tiles all within the one sprite image (but
<i>not</i> as sprite frames, so a single large sprite frame with
all the animation images within it), and then in the tile set
editor you click on the <b>Tile Animation</b> button to bring up
the <b>Animation Editor</b>: <img class="center" src=
"images/04_01_animations.png" alt="Animation"></p>

<p>The example image above is a single image with all animation
frames contained within it, but it should be noted that the image
could also contain other non-animation tiles too, since you can use
a single massive tile set and then "cherry pick" the parts of it
that you want to create the animation from. For example, you could
have a large landscape tile set with trees, earth and water, and
within the tile set have multiple tiles to be animated to make the
water ripple.</p>

<p>To create a tile animation you first have to add an animation to
the animation library by clicking the <b>Add Animation</b> button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_addproxy.png">,
which will add an empty animation strip to the library and request
that you select a number of frames to be used: <img class="center"
src="images/04_02_animationadd.png" alt="Add Animation"></p>

<p>You will then be presented with a view of each empty animation
frame, with the initial frame highlighted for you: <img class=
"center" src="images/04_03_emptyanim.png" alt=
"Empty Animation"></p>

<p>If you then go back to the tile set image on the left of the
editor you can click on any tile to add it into the animation and
the frame will advance to the next one. Clicking successive tiles
will fill up the animation, which you can then preview by clicking
on the "play" button beside the frames: <img class="center" src=
"images/04_04_addframes.gif" alt="Add Animation Frames"></p>

<p>Once you have done that your animation will become part of the
animation library and when you enter the room editor you can select
it and place it within the room. Note that if you select <i>any</i>
of the tiles from an animation to place in a room, that tile will
animate from the tile onwards, so you can "desynchronise" an
animation by placing separate frames within the room and they will
all animate. The only caveat to this is that the animation speed
will always be the same, since it is defined for the whole tile set
and not individual animations within the library.</p>

<p>A few things to note about tiles that are being used in
animations:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the tile has its own animation specified (so there is an
animation where it is set as the first tile) then it will use that
animation.</li>

<li>If the tile doesn't have its own animation but is used in only
one other animation, then it will use that animation starting at
the first position that tile is present in the animation.</li>

<li>If the tile doesn't have its own animation and is used in
multiple other animations, then it will not animate at all. You
will need to explicitly specify an animation with it as the first
tile.</li>

<p>The <b>Auto Tile</b> feature is an incredibly powerful tool that
can be used to make level building much easier, whether it is for a
top down or side on view project. Essentially, you create an
autotile library, and then whenever you lay down a tile from that
library it will "connect" with those tiles that are around it to
create a seamless wall or platform.</p>

<p>Before you start using the autotile feature however, it is very
important that you have set up the tile set sprite correctly and
that you choose an appropriate type of autotile. The types
available to you are 47 tile autotiles, or 16 tile autotiles, with
(in general) 16 tiles being used for top down (since they give
nicer transitions) and 47 being used for platformer/side on views,
but that is by no means a hard and fast rule and will depend on how
you want your final project to look.</p>

<p>The image below shows a typical 47 tile and 16 tile tile set for
autotiling: <img class="center" src="images/05_01_autotiles.png"
alt="Two Autotile Examples"></p>

<p>Now, just looking at the images doesn't really tell you how they
will fit together so we'll open the Autotile Editor from the Tile
Set Editor and add them. The Autotile Editor looks like this:
<img class="center" src="images/05_02_autotileeditor.png" alt=
"Autotile Editor"></p>

<p>Note that the sprite being used has ALL the tiles we require
(and can also have other tiles, since you can pick and choose which
ones to be in the autotile). You can now click <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on the 47
tile button in the <b>Templates</b> area to create a new 47 tile
library entry and it will bring up the template to use for
selecting the tiles you need: <img class="center" src=
"images/05_03_47tiles.png" alt="47 Tile Template"></p>

<p>In the template, the light grey area represents the outside edge
of the tile being used and the darker grey is the "fill" area. To
add a tile into the template, simply click on the first available
template cell and then select the tile to add from the left:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="images/add_tiles.gif" alt=
"Adding Tiles Animation">
</p>

<p>If you make a mistake, simply select the autotile that you want
to remove and select the "empty" tile from the tile set. After you
have added them all in you can check the tiles against the template
by clicking the "Show Template" button <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_template.png"> at the top,
and this will toggle the template overlay on the final autotile, as
shown in the image below: <img class="center" src=
"images/show_template.gif" alt="Show The Autotile Template"></p>

<p>If you want to make a 16 tile autotile, the proceedure is
exactly the same as that explained above, only instead of using the
47 tile template you use the 16 tile template:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="images/16tiles.gif" alt=
"16 Tile Template">
</p>

<p>We now have some autotiles in our autotile library taken from a
tile set. These can be used in the room editor by simply creating a
tilemap layer and then selecting one of the autotiles from the
library (which will select automatically the autotile brush from
the top of the room editor) and painting in your room. The tiles
will now "auto-magically" connect up to create properly sequenced
tile maps.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="images/roomtile.gif" alt=
"Autotile In The Room Editor">
</p>

<p>Please note that the behaviour of an autotile around the room
edges will depend on the <b>Open Or Closed Edges</b> button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_opencloseedges.png">. By default when an autotile is
placed along the edge of a room, it will choose a tile as if the
outside of the room was empty (ie: it'll give the room an "edge").
However if you click this button, the autotile will tile the room
as if the area outside was filled with tiles and so choose tiles
that blend and have no "edge".</p>
