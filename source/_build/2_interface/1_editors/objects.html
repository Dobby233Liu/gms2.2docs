</p>

<p>Objects are the resource that we use to control aspects of a
game and to do specific things. Most of the time they have a sprite
associated with them so that you see them in the game rooms, but
sometimes they are used as a "behind the scenes" controller to do
things related to the user or for timing, etc... They can be given
behaviours and they can react to certain events as well as to each
other, and most of the things you see in a game are based on
objects and their interactions. Now, we say "based on" because you
don't actually place objects directly into the game rooms, but
rather you place <b>instances</b> of these objects which are
basically copies (or clones if you prefer) of the object resource.
This is a very important thing to remember as instances and objects
are <i>not the same thing</i> and each have their own set of
functions that can affect them.</p>

<p>To clarify this, think of a game made with <i>GameMaker Studio
2</i>. All the characters, monsters, balls, walls, etc... are all
objects you create in the resource tree. You then drag the object
into a room in the <a href="rooms.html">Room Editor</a> to create
an <b>instance</b> copied from the basic object template. The
instance in the room can then be changed in the editor itself or
through code, so that it can be scaled, or coloured, or have other
details modified from the "base" object. So when we talk about
something affecting or changing an instance, we mean it affects
that <i>one particular copy of an object in a room</i>. Only that
single instance is being affected while all the rest are not. But,
when we talk about affecting or changing an <b>object</b>, we mean
that we are modifying the object in the resource tree and anything
we do to it will be reflected in all the instances created from
that point on too. So, the object is the template for the instance,
and the instance is what we place in a room to make our game.</p>

<p>To create an object in your game, you can right click
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_rmb.png">
on the object resource folder and click the <i>Create</i> option.
This will open the window pictured at the top of this page with the
following sections:</p>

<blockquote><a name="object_details" id="object_details"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="one">Details</label> <input id="one"
type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>Here you can give your object a name. This name should never
contain spaces nor unauthorized characters (only alpha-numeric
characters and the underbar "_" are allowed) and should be short
but memorable so that you can easily identify resources later when
you may have many of them. For example many people use a prefix or
a suffix to identify the differences between resources, like
"obj_Ship" or "Ship_obj".</p>

<p>Next you can choose the sprite for the object should you wish it
to have one. Click with the left mouse button <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on the
sprite box and the <b>Asset Explorer</b> will appear with a list of
all the available sprites from the resource tree: <img class=
"center" src="images/editor_objects_assetexplorer.png" alt=
"Asset Explorer"></p>

<p>You can then select the one you want to use for the object. With
a sprite assigned to the object you can click the Edit Sprite
button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_editsprite.png"> to change the sprite properties, or
if you do not have a sprite for the object but wish to create one
you can click the Add Sprite button <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_newsprite.png"> to create
a new sprite resource and assign that. You can also edit the sprite
resource image that has been assigned by clicking the Edit Image
button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_editimage.png"> to open the Image Editor.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="object_collision_mask" id="object_collision_mask"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="nineteen">Collision Mask</label>
<input id="nineteen" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>Beneath the sprite assignment area you have a button for
choosing a specific <b>Collision Mask</b>. By default an object
will use the collision properties of the sprite assigned to it, but
there are cases whereby you may want collisions to be based off of
a different mask shape. For example, you may have a top down game
where the main sprite has a rectangular collision mask, but to make
collisions smoother a circular mask may be better. In these cases
you can click the Collision Mask button and select another sprite
resource, so now instances of the object will <i>draw</i> the
assigned sprite, but base collisions off of the <i>mask</i>
sprite.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="object_properties" id="object_properties"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="two">Properties</label> <input id=
"two" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>Here you are presented with the following options for your
object:</p>

<blockquote><a name="object_visible" id="object_visible"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="four">Visible</label> <input id="four"
type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p><b>Visible</b> indicates whether instances of this object are
visible when the room starts. Normally most instances are visible
but sometimes it is useful to have invisible ones - for example,
you can use them for way-points to control a moving monster, or to
keep track values and perform certain timed actions. Invisible
objects will still react to events and if they have a sprite or a
mask assigned to them, they will also react should other instances
collide with them... they just cannot be seen and do not perform
their <b>draw</b> event. By default, the visible flag is
checked.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="object_solid" id="object_solid"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="a">Solid</label> <input id="a" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>When you flag an instance as being solid, you are telling
<i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> that it should try to resolve any
collisions before triggering a <b>collision event</b>. This is a
<i>very</i> basic functionality, and in reality all it does is move
the instance back to the position it was in the moment before a
collision was detected before performing any code or DnDâ„¢ that is
in the event itself, and as such is of limited use.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="object_persistence" id="object_persistence"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="five">Persistent</label> <input id=
"five" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p><b>Persistent</b> - A persistent object is one that does not go
away when the room is changed, but rather it "persists" and is
carried over into the new room. It will only disappear when you
explicitly destroy it, either with a destroy action or in code.
This means that if you place a persistent object in one room, it
will still be available in all subsequent rooms and will continue
to perform any actions assigned to the events in its object
properties, <i>except</i> the create event, which is only fired
once when it is created initially and not when you change to a new
room. This is handy for when you have, for example, a main
character that moves from room to room and you want to maintain the
variables within that object the same, but you should take great
care to create and destroy persistent objects correctly as you can
easily get errors creeping into your project by mistake.</p>

<p>When you create an instance with persistence enabled in a room,
it will be assigned a layer or a depth (depending on which function
you used to create the instance of the object). When the room is
changed, and if the following room does <i>not</i> have a layer
with the same name or depth as the one assigned, then a new layer
will be created for the instance that is persisting across the
rooms. If you gave a named layer when the instance was created,
then the new layer will also be named the same as original layer,
while if you assigned a depth to the instance then the new layer
will be named "<tt>_layer_XXX</tt>", where "XXX" is a hex value
used to give the layer a unique name. These layers will be removed
from the room on Room End. Another thing to note about layers and
persistent instances is that if you have assigned the instance a
named layer on creation, and there is another layer in the
following rooms with the same name, then the persisted instance
will be assigned to the layer with the same name <i>regardless of
the depth of the layer</i>. Finally, if a persisted instance moves
to a room with a layer at the same depth as the instance was
created on, it will <i>not</i> be assigned to this layer, but
instead a new layer will be created at the same depth (following
the naming convention explained previously).</p>

<p>Note too that a persistent object will still have its Game
Start, Game End, Room Start and Room End events triggered, however
if you restart the game (with, for example, the game_restart()
function) all persistent objects will be removed and only exist
when created again by the game. Also note that if you deactivate a
persistent object, it will no longer pass from one room to another
unless re-activated <i>before</i> the Room End event is triggered.
Re-activation requires a full game step to occur, so using the
actual Room End event for this does not work, as it doesn't give
the game a full step to reactivate the object.</p>

<label class="collapse" for="six">Uses Physics</label> <input id=

<div class="index_list">
<p>When you check the <b>Uses Physics</b> box you are telling
<i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> that this object should be part of a
<a href="rooms.html#room_physics">physics world</a>. Checking this
will also open a further chained window where you can define the
physical properties of all instances of this object. More

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>The options section defines the different property options for
your object and how the instances will behave when placed in a
room. Here you add events, which are the "building blocks" of your
game code, set whether the object is to have a parent and also set
the physics properties if you want to enable the physics
functions.</p>

<blockquote><a name="object_events" id="object_events"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="seven">Events</label> <input id=
"seven" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>So, what are events? Basically, these are discreet moments in
the game loop where things are made to happen based on what you
have programmed for them. <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> works with
cycles of these events - from the moment a room is started to the
moment it is finished there is a game loop running where every
<b>step</b> (a step is a moment in game time, governed by the room
speed setting) a series of events are run or checked, and you can
choose to place code or DnD actions in your objects that respond to
these events.</p>

<p>Let's look at a typical object setup with events and code:
<img class="center" src="images/editor_objects_events.png" alt=
"Object Editor Events View"></p>

<p>As you can see in our example object there are a number of
events listed that it should respond to, but initially when you
create an object this list is empty and you must decide which
events you need and what instances of that object should do when
those events are triggered. To add events into the object, you
press the <b>Add Event</b> button found at the bottom of the events
list which will bring up the following window: <img class="center"
src="images/editor_objects_eventlist.png" alt=
"Object Editor Events List"></p>

<p>That is the list of all the basic events which an object can
respond to, although some of those events also have <b>sub
events</b> to further refine behaviours. For example, if you add a
Key Press <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"events/images/icon_keyboardpress.png"> event you will then get a
further window popping up with the sub events that allow you to
select which key the object should respond to. Once you have
selected your event, the <a href="scripts.html">code window</a>
will be chained to it and open up on the right. You can now edit
the code to give your object a specific behaviour or reaction to
that event.</p>

<p>You can click the right mouse button <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_rmb.png"> on any
event to get the following menu options: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_objects_rmbmenu.png" alt=
"Object Editor Events Menu"></p>

<p>These options are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Add Event</b> - Add a new event from the event list.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Cut / Copy / Paste Events</b> - Cut, copy or paste the
selected event. You can use the standard keyboard shortcuts too:
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png">/<img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_cmd.png"> + <tt>X</tt>, <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png">/<img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_cmd.png"> + <tt>C</tt>, and <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_ctrl.png">/<img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="../../images/icon_cmd.png"> + <tt>V</tt>.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Duplicate Event</b> - Duplicate the chosen event. This will
take the contents of the chosen event and duplicate them in another
event that you specify.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Change Event</b> - Change the event. This will prompt you to
choose another event category and once selected the contents of the
current event will be changed to the new event (removing the
original event in the process).<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Convert To Drag and Drop / Code</b> - Object events will be
created using the method chosen when you created the project,
either using code or using Drag and Drop actions. With this option
you can convert from one to the other, regardless of the project
type.<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Delete Event</b> - Delete the event (or events).</li>
</ul>

<p>When removing events, you can use <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_shift.png"> +
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png">
to select multiple events and then delete them all together.</p>

<p>You should also note that you can <b>name events</b>, or at
least give them a short descriptive text that will be shown beside
them in the Event Editor. To do this, simply add the following into
the very first line of the code editor for the event:</p>

<p class="code">/// @description Your text here</p>

<p>So, you could have something like this in - for example - an
Alarm event</p>

<p class="code">/// @description This is the AI Fight alarm</p>

<p>And now in your Event Editor you'll see this: <img class=
"center" src="images/editor_objects_namedevents.png" alt=
"Object Editor Named Events"></p>
</div>
<br></blockquote>

<p>Note that the section on events above simply gives an overview
of how they work, but for full details on all the avaialble events,
please see the following section:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><a href="events/index.html"><span class="list_link">Object
Events List</span></a>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The other options for an object are:</p>

<blockquote><a name="object_parent" id="object_parent"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="eight">Parent</label> <input id=
"eight" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>When working with objects in the <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> IDE,
you can set up <b>Parent / Child hierarchies</b>. This is done by
clicking the "Parent" button in the object editor and then choosing
another object from the resource tree to be the "parent" of the one
being edited: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_objects_parent.png" alt="Parents"></p>

<p>So, every object in your game project can have a parent object,
but what does this mean? Well, when an object has a parent assigned
it can share code, actions and events with that parent. This
sharing is called "inheritance" and an object that has a parent is
called a "child" object. Not only can a child share code with its
parent, but you can do checks and run code on parent objects and it
will automatically include the child objects too, which saves a lot
of time and energy.</p>

<p>If that sounds complicated, then another way to look at a parent
object is as a way to "group" objects together under the same
umbrella and have them share certain things without losing their
own unique identity. Maybe that still doesn't clarify things too
much, so let's give some examples...</p>

<p>Say you have a "player" object and four different "enemy"
objects. Now, you want the player to die if he touches any of these
four objects and this would normally entail four different
collision events with four different sets of actions or code, one
for each of the enemy objects. BUT if we make a <i>parent</i>
object for all the enemies, then we can create one collision event
with the parent object only and it will trigger no matter which one
of the four "child" enemy objects touch the player. Handy stuff! In
the actual <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> object you would see something
like this: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_object_parentcollision.png" alt="Parents"></p>

<p>On the left we have four separate collision events and on the
right we have a single collision event, as we have created a
"parent" object and assigned all the enemy objects to it. Note that
a parent object doesn't have to have any events or code in
it...</p>

<p>Another example of parenting would be if you have a game where
you want to create 10 different looking objects and have them all
behave in the same way. For that you would create one parent object
and in that have all your behaviour actions or code in the required
events, and then you would create your ten objects with <i>no</i>
actions or code, but different sprites, and assign them your parent
object. Now, when you place these instances in a room they will all
behave the same, but look different, since they will "inherit" the
events of the parent.</p>

<p>Finally you can use parenting to "mix and match" events and
behaviours. We'll illustrate this with one final example... Say you
want two monsters: one that moves up and down, while another that
moves left and right, but you also want the two of them to have the
same health, shoot at the player and hurt the player if they
collide with them. In this case you can see that almost all events
should have the same actions except for one or two that govern
movement. So, again, we can make one object the parent of the
other, but in this case we also define certain events for the child
object. These events "override" the parent events, meaning that
whenever an event for the child object contains actions, these are
executed instead of the actions contained in the event of the
parent. If you also want to execute the parent event you can call
the so-called "inherited" event using the function <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/objects/generating%20events/event_inherited.html">
<tt>event_inherited()</tt></a>, or the DnDâ„¢ action <a href=
"../../3_scripting/2_drag_and_drop_reference/instance_actions/call_parent_event.html">
Call Parent Event</a>. <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_object_inheritevents.png" alt=
"Inheriting Events"></p>

<p>On the left above is the parent object with 5 events in it, and
on the right you can see the "child" object. The child object also
has 5 events in it, but two of them <i>override</i> the inherited
events from the parent (the <b>Step</b> and <b>Draw</b> events) and
the other three are greyed out as they are the events inherited
from the parent. Inherited events will also have the "parent
override" icon beside them in the Event Editor: <img class="center"
src="images/editor_object_parentoverride.png" alt=
"Parent Override"></p>

<p>When you click <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_lmb.png"> on an event that has been inherited,
it will open the code editor to show the inherited parent code, but
you will <i>not</i> be able to edit this code as you can only edit
it in the parent object itself. You can click the right mouse
button <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"../../images/icon_rmb.png"> on any of the parent events to open
the following menu of options: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_object_parent_menu.png" alt=
"Parent Event RMB Menu"></p>

<p>Here you can choose two <b>Open</b> the parent event to inspect
the code, or you can choose to <b>Inherit</b> the event or
<b>Override</b> the event. If you choose <b>Inherit</b> then the
code editor will open with the funtion <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/objects/generating%20events/event_inherited.html">
<tt>event_inherited()</tt></a> already added to it (or the <a href=
"../../3_scripting/2_drag_and_drop_reference/instance_actions/call_parent_event.html">
Call Parent Event</a> action if using DnDâ„¢). Any further code you
place in this event will now be run <i>as well as</i> the code that
the parent object has. If you choose to <b>Override</b> the event,
then the code window will also open, only now the
<tt>event_inherited()</tt> function won't be called, so anything
you add here will be run <i>instead of</i> the code in the parent
object.</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: From the code editor you can quickly
navigate to the parent object by clicking the right mouse button
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_rmb.png">
and selecting <b>Go To Object</b> from the pop-up menu, or (if the
event has been overridden) you can select <b>Open Inherited
Event</b> to go directly to a code editor with the parent event
code in it.</div>

<p><br>
Whenever you target a parent object in code, the code will also
apply to the "children" of the parent object too. This happens
when, in an action, you indicate that the action must be applied to
instances of a certain object, and in code it happens when you use
the <tt>with()</tt> statement. It will work like this too when you
call code functions, like <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/instances/instance_functions/instance_position.html">
<tt>instance_position</tt></a>, <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/instances/instance_functions/instance_number.html">
<tt>instance_number</tt></a>, etc... where if you supply a parent
object then all instances of the parent <i>and</i> child instances
will be included in the checks. Finally, parenting works when you
refer to variables in other objects too, like in the above monster
example if I set the enemy 1 speed to 10, then the enemy 2 speed
will also go to ten as it is a child object of enemy 1.</p>

<p>It is generally considered good practice in most cases to create
one base parent object and have this base object contain all the
default behaviour but never use an instance of it in the game.
Rather use all child objects and only use the parent in situations
like those I have outlined above, for collisions, for referencing
variables, etc... You should also realise that parents can have
parents too! Obviously you can't create a cycle of "parent 1 is
child of parent 2 is child of parent 1" but you can create what is
called "object hierarchy" where "parent3 is child of parent2 is
child of parent1". This is extremely useful to keep your game
structured and you are strongly advised to learn to use this
mechanism.</p>

<div class="index_list">
<p>When you first create a new object resource, there is a
check-box marked <b>Uses Physics</b>, which is not checked by
default. Selecting this option will radically change the behaviour
of your object when an instance of it is placed in a room, as this
switches on the object's physical properties and means that its
"traditional" movement and collision functions are no longer valid
(but only when the room it is placed on is also marked as being a
physics room. See - <a href="rooms.html">The Room Editor</a>). When
you check this, the object resource window opens a new chained
window for the physics editor: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_objects_physics.png" alt=
"Object Editor Physics"></p>

<p>Before you start to edit the values for the physics behaviours
it's a good idea to first set the <b>collision shape</b>. With the
"normal" collision system your collisions are based off of the mask
of the sprite assigned to the object, but with physics enabled this
is no longer the case. We need to assign a <b>collision shape</b>
the object ourselves (this is properly called a <b>fixture</b>, see
<a href="../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/physics/index.html">The
Physics Functions</a> for more information), which can either be a
circle, a rectangle or a polygon shape that you yourself define.
Clicking on the <b>Modify Collision Shape</b> button will open the
following chained window to edit the shape: <img class="center"

<p>This looks similar to the <a href="paths.html">Path Editor</a>,
and functions in much the same way. However, depending on the mask
you have chosen, it can be rather more restrictive:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have a <b>circular</b> mask, then you can only pull any
of the path points to make the circle diameter larger or
smaller</li>

<li>If you have <b>rectangular</b> mask, then you can move any of
the four corners, but the corresponding ones will adjust position
automatically to always maintain a rectangle</li>

<li>If you have a <b>custom</b> (polygon) mask, it must have a
minimum of 3 and a maximum of 8 points to it, and it must be convex
(see image below).</li>
</ul>
<img class="center" src="images/editor_object_physicsshape.png"
alt="Object Editor Physics Shape Type">
<p>Once you have set up your shape, you then need to define the
basic physical properties that your object is to have. These are
configured by changing the following parameters:</p>

<blockquote><a name="object_physics_density" id=
"object_physics_density"></a> <label class="collapse" for=
"ten">Density</label> <input id="ten" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The density of something is defined as its <i>mass per unit
volume</i>, which basically means how much mass is crammed into the
space it takes up in the world. So, a balloon would have a low
density as it has little mass that occupies a large space, while a
lead bar would have a high density as it has a great mass, yet
occupies little space. In the <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> 2D physics
world, mass is calculated automatically for you from the values you
input for the density and by the surface area of the shape you
define for the fixture. This will have a direct impact on how much
inertia a fixture has as well as how it reacts to collisions and
forces, so if you make a small shape with a high density it will
have a very large mass (like a bar of lead), but if you define a
large shape with a low density it will have a much smaller mass
(like a balloon).</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="object_physics_restitution" id=
"object_physics_restitution"></a> <label class="collapse" for=
"eleven">Restitution</label> <input id="eleven" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>In physics, restitution is defined as "<i>the return of an
object or system to its original state after elastic
deformation</i>", but as the fixtures in the <i>GameMaker Studio
2</i> are really <b>rigid bodies</b> and cannot be deformed,
restitution is really a way of saying how "bouncy" the fixture is.
This setting will affect how much an object "bounces" when it
collides with other objects and is co-dependant on other forces
that act on the instance like gravity and friction.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="object_physics_collisiongroup" id=
"object_physics_collisiongroup"></a> <label class="collapse" for=
"twelve">Collision Group</label> <input id="twelve" type=
"checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>By default, the collision group for all physics objects is
<b>0</b>, and this means that they will interact as normal, which
in turn means they <b>must have a collision event to interact</b>
(a simple comment will do to trigger the collision) otherwise no
collision will be registered. However, you can also specify that an
object should belong to a specific <b>collision group</b>. By
assigning objects to a positive collision group (ie: three objects
are all in group "<b>2</b>") you are telling <i>GameMaker Studio
2</i> that instances of these objects should <i>always collide</i>,
even if they have nothing in their collision event, obeying the
physical properties that you have assigned them and the room they
are in. Conversely, if you have objects with a negative collision
group (ie: four objects assigned "<b>-1</b>"), you are telling
<i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> that these should <i>never collide</i>,
and any collision events between them will be ignored.</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: Using collision groups dramatically
increases the processing required by the physics system and should
be used only when absolutely necessary, and you should have as few
groups as possible.</div>
</div>
<br>
<a name="object_physics_linear" id="object_physics_linear"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="thirteen">Linear Damping</label>
<input id="thirteen" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>Damping is used to reduce the physics world velocity of an
instance, and differs from friction in that friction only occurs
when two instances with collision shapes (fixtures) are in contact.
Damping is also much cheaper to simulate than friction, but please
note that damping is not a replacement for friction; the two
effects can, and should, be used together.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="object_physics_angular" id="object_physics_angular"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="fourteen">Angular Damping</label>
<input id="fourteen" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>If you think about any rotating object in the "real world",
unless it has a motor or is in space, it slows down over time due
to the influence of external forces (like friction with the air
around it). We can use set this option to simulate this effect and
reduce the velocity of rotation of instances in the physics world,
as, without it, any rotating instance would continue to rotate
infinitely.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="object_physics_friction" id="object_physics_friction"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="fifteen">Friction</label> <input id=
"fifteen" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>Friction is the force that resists the relative motion of
material elements sliding against each other, which in the
GameMaker Studio 2 physics world, translates as the loss of
momentum caused by the collision of two instances with fixtures
bound to them. So, when two instances collide, their motion is
affected by this value, with a high friction causing a larger loss
of momentum than a lower value.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<p>Finally there are three extra options that can flagged as on or
off for your fixture, Sensor, Start Awake and Kinematic. Each of
these flags will change the behaviour of your fixture in the
following ways:</p>

<blockquote><a name="object_physics_sensor" id=
"object_physics_sensor"></a> <label class="collapse" for=
"sixteen">Sensor</label> <input id="sixteen" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>By checking this box, you are telling GameMaker Studio 2 to
basically "ignore" the physical properties of the object, but still
return a collision event with the objects around it. in this way
you can have an instance with no physical presence in the room, but
which can react to the collision of another instance, like the
player, and do something in turn, like open a door, or trigger some
sort of action in another place in the room.</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: A sensor fixture will fire off the
collision event when the collision <b>first occurs only</b>,
meaning you don't get a stream of collision events as the two
bodies continue to overlap (which is what would traditionally
occur). If they stop overlapping and overlap subsequently there
will be another collision event triggered.</div>
</div>
<br>
<a name="object_physics_awake" id="object_physics_awake"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="seventeen">Start Awake</label>
<input id="seventeen" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>This is checked by default and represents the initial "state" of
the fixture at the start of the room it has been placed in.
Normally you want it to be awake (ie: participating in the physics
world) right from the start, but sometimes this can lead to certain
instabilities and unwanted effects due to the abrupt start of the
physics simulation. To avoid these effects, you can un-check this
flag and the instance will be created with the fixture asleep, and
it will not participate in the physics simulation unless something
acts upon it.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="object_physics_kinematic" id=
"object_physics_kinematic"></a> <label class="collapse" for=
"eighteen">Kinematic</label> <input id="eighteen" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>There will be certain instances in a physics based game which
you want to move around but do not wish to be acted on by forces
such as gravity, nor forces incurred by collisions with dynamic
objects (think of moving platforms in a platform game, for
example). For such objects simply setting the density of the
fixture to 0 will mean that the physics will assume that the object
is intended to be static and it will not react at all to anything.
However, checking this box will make a static object kinematic and
although it will be unaffected by collisions and gravity, it can
still be moved around or rotated using the appropriate
variables.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<br>
<a name="object_variables" id="object_variables"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="twenty">Variables</label> <input id="twenty" type=
"checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>When you click on the <b>Variables</b> button it will open up
the <b>Object Variables</b> window, which you can then use to
generate any number of variables <i>before</i> the <b>Create
Event</b>: <img class="center" src=
"images/editor_object_variables.png" alt=
"Object Editor Variables Window"></p>

<p>In this window you can click on the <b>Add a new variable</b>
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_addvariable.png"> button to add a new variable to the
list. You can then name the variable as well as set the <b>type</b>
of variable it has to use and adjust its properties: <img class=
"center" src="images/editor_object_newvariable.png" alt=
"Object Editor New Variable"></p>

<p>The variable name must start with a letter and can contain
<i>only letters, numbers, and the underscore symbol '_'</i> with a
maximum length of 64 symbols. So, valid variables are things like
<tt>fish</tt>, <tt>foo_bar</tt>, <tt>num1</tt>, and invalid
variables would be <tt>6fish</tt>, <tt>foo bar</tt>, or
<tt>*num</tt>. Once you have given the name of the variable you
need to set its type, which can be any of the following:
<img class="center" src="images/editor_object_variabletypes.png"
alt="Object Editor Variable Types"></p>

<p>It is worth noting that this feature is particularly useful when
working with parent/child instances - since you can have a parent
object with a set of defined variables and then simply modify them
in child object (see the section <b>Object Variables And Child
Objects</b> below for more details) - and for when you add
instances into the <a href="rooms.html">Room Editor</a> (see the
section on <b>Layers &gt; Instance Layer</b>), since you can also
modify these variables for individual instances that have been
placed in the room.</p>

"d">Variable Types</label> <input id="d" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The different types of variable that you can create are listed
below:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Real</b>: A real number is any number that is not a whole
integer and can be positive or negative. So, 124.5,
45639.566546456, 0.9, -45.5 etc... are all examples of real
numbers. All real numbers are stored as 64bit floating point values
(doubles). Note that you can set a range of values for the output
real from the <b>Variable Options</b> (see below for more
details).</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Integer</b>: An integer is a whole number and can be
positive or negative, for example 30004, 19, 0, -300. Note that you
can set a range of values for the output integer from the
<b>Variable Options</b> (see below for more details).</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>String</b>: A string is anything that has been placed within
double quotation marks, for example "fish", "Hello World", or
"12345".</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Boolean</b>: A boolean is a value that is either
<tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt>. In the Object Editor Variables
window, this is simply shown as a box that you check for
<tt>true</tt> and uncheck for <tt>false</tt>.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Expression</b>: An expression is a mathematical phrase that
can contain ordinary numbers, variables, strings, or GML functions
as well as one or more <i>operators</i>. For example <tt>sqrt(85 *
6) + 5.5</tt> is an expression.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Resource</b>: A resource is simply any one of the resources
that you have defined in the resource tree. When you select this
resource type, you can then click on the <b>Open Asset Explorer</b>
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_openassetexplorer.png"> button to open the Asset
Explorer and select the resource you require. Note that you can set
filters for the assets shown in the Asset Explorer from the
<b>Variable Options</b> (see below for more details).</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>List</b>: Selecting a list type of input means that you can
then create a selection of values (these can be strings, reals,
expressions etc...) of which you can then choose one or more for
the variable to return. To define the items that go in the list you
need to add them into the <b>Variable Options</b> first (see below

the default value for the variable in the main window from the drop
down menu: <img class="center" src=

Note that if you have <b>Multi-select</b> ticked in the List
Options (see below) then the variable will become an array of all
the selected options.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Colour</b>: The colour type is for you to define a colour
value to be stored in the variable. You can input a real number
(from 0 to 16777216, this will have an alpha value of 255), or a
hex value (in the format of $RRGGBBAA), or you can double click
<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="../../images/icon_lmb.png">

<div class="index_list">
<p>An important feature of the Object Variables is that they are
<i>inherited</i> by any child objects that you have in the resource
tree (see the section on <b>Parents</b> above), which means that
you can then choose to override or change any or all of them if you
wish. When you create a child object of another object resource
that has Variables defined for it, these will show up in the Object
Variables window like this: <img class="center" src=

"Object Editor Variable In A Child Object"></p>

<p>You can see in the top image that the Parent object has four
Object Variables and in the bottom image these are also shown, only
"greyed out" and have the <b>Inherited From Parent</b> <img style=
"vertical-align:middle" src="images/icon_inheritedvariable.png">
icon to indicate that they have been inherited. These inherited
variables can then be edited if you click the <b>Override
Variable</b> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_overridevariable.png"> button, so you can then adjust
the range slider or values, or select different items from lists,
etc... Note that when you edit a parent variable you can only
change the defined value but not the name, nor can you change the
variable options. Also note that you can add in new Object
Variables to child objects as well (and in the example image above
you can see that "Character Type" is new Object Variable only for
the child object).</p>

<p>If you have edited an inherited Object Variable, then you can
click the <b>Delete</b> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src=
"images/icon_deletevariable.png"> button to remove the edit, <i>but
not the variable</i>. The variable will still be inherited from the
parent, but will use the parent default value again. If you need to
completely remove the variable, then you must do this from the
parent object.</p>
