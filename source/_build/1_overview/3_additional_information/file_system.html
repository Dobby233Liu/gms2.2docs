<h2>The File System</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">
<p><br>
</p>

<p>When using the <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/file%20handling/index.html">file
system functions</a> or <a href=
"../../2_interface/1_editors/included_files.html">included
files</a> with <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> it is vitally important to
know exactly how everything works and what things are going on
behind the scenes. To that end, this section is designed to explain
and clarify exactly how things are stored, where they are stored
and what possible limits or workarounds there may be to this
system.</p>

<blockquote><a name="file_sandbox" id="file_sandbox"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="one">The Sandbox</label> <input id=
"one" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>The first and most important thing to note about the file
functions is that they are limited - in general - to the
<i>sandbox</i>. What this means is that <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i>
cannot save or load files from anywhere that is not part of the
game bundle or the local storage for the device without
<i>explicit</i> input from the user, and even then this input is
limited to <b>only</b> <i>Windows</i>, <i>macOS</i> and <i>Ubuntu
(Linux)</i> target platforms.</p>

<p>To understand the sandbox first of all you need to understand
that there are two distinct areas for files:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>The File Bundle</b> - this is where all the files that are
packaged with the executable game are stored, including the files
that you have added to the <a href=
"../../2_interface/1_editors/included_files.html">Included
Files</a> resource list from the <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> IDE
(which are the external files that you want packaged with the
game).<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>The Save Area</b> - this is an area of device storage that
can be safely written to by the game and the game is guaranteed
that this is a writeable area.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following diagram may help you to visualise this better:
<img class="center" src="images/files_saveareas.png" alt=
"File System Save Areas"></p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> You can <b>never</b> write to the
File Bundle directory.</div>

<p>It is possible to turn off the sandboxing, however, on the
Desktop targets (Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu (Linux)) by checking
the <b>Disable file system sandbox</b> option in the Game Options
for the target platform. You do this at your own risk, and while
this will open up file saving and loading and permit you to access
files anywhere on the given system, it may still be limited by the
OS permissions.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="file_functions" id="file_functions"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="two">Using the File Functions</label> <input id=
"two" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>When your game is sandboxed, the two target areas - the bundle
directory and the local storage area - are available on each target
platform, but on each one they will work slightly differently.
However <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> has abstracted out the main
essence of what can and can't be done, making it easier to
re-target games to multiple environments.</p>

<p>To start with, you should understand what is meant when we talk
of the <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/file%20handling/working_directory.html">
<tt>working_directory</tt></a>. This is a synonym for the two
possible save locations (as illustrated by the diagram above) and
when you use that directory it will do one of two things depending
on whether you are reading or writing, and whether the file you are
reading from has been changed or not:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Reading Operations</b> - <tt>working_directory</tt> will
first check the save area to see if the file being accessed is
there, and if it is uses that. However if the file does not exists
in the save area, it then checks the file bundle area and uses that
(if the file being looked for is an included file with your
game).<br>
<br></li>

<li><b>Writing Operations</b> - This can only happen in the save
area.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> in general <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i>
will handle all this for you and you rarely need to use the
<tt>working_directory</tt> built in variable.</div>

<p>Using these two simple rules we can now see how the following
functions work (these are examples to help you to visualise the
process for the different functions available):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/file%20handling/directory_create.html">
<tt>directory_create</tt></a> (and the other directory functions)
will only work in the save area.<br>
<br></li>

<li>the <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/file%20handling/index.html">file
system</a> functions will return information on files from
<i>both</i> the bundle and the save area, but will only write to
the save area.<br>
<br></li>

<li>the functions for writing text, binary or INI files will create
a new file in the save area if one does not already exist, copying
over any information from the <i>original</i> files included with
the game bundle should they exist. Note that the original files
will <i>still remain in the read-only part of the save
directory</i>, but they won't be referenced as long as a version
exists in the read/write section of the save area.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>
<a name="file_outside" id="file_outside"></a> <label class=
"collapse" for="three">Saving And Loading Outside The
Sandbox</label> <input id="three" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>On the <b>Windows</b>, <b>macOS</b> and <b>Ubuntu (Linux)</b>
platforms there are two ways to save and load files from outside of
the sandbox and that is either using the functions <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/file%20handling/file%20system/get_open_filename.html">
<tt>get_open_filename</tt></a> and <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/file%20handling/file%20system/get_save_filename.html">
<tt>get_save_filename</tt></a> (both of these functions will
require that the user select an area for loading and saving and the
return string can then be used in the rest of the file functions to
bypass the sandbox - see the function descriptions in the <a href=
"../../3_scripting/index.html">scripting section</a> of the manual
for more details). The other way is to disable the sandbox
altogether from the Game Options for the target platform (only
available for Desktop targets).</p>

<p>On <b>HTML5</b> it is also possible to load files from outside
the sandbox from a server, however this should only be done using
the function <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/buffers/buffer_load_async.html"><tt>
buffer_load_async()</tt></a> as loading synchronously has been
deprecated on most browsers and will eventually be obsoleted. This
means that files being loaded in this way should be saved as binary
files - for example, you can save an <tt>*.ini</tt> as a string
(see <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/file%20handling/ini%20files/ini_close.html">
<tt>ini_close</tt></a> for details) and then write that into a
buffer which can then be saved and loaded using the async
functions. Note that if you are loading images using <a href=
"../../3_scripting/4_gml_reference/sprites/sprite_add.html"><tt>sprite_add</tt></a>
then these are already dealt with asynchronously.</p>
</div>
<br>
<a name="file_platform_specific" id="file_platform_specific"></a>
<label class="collapse" for="four">Platform Specific
Saving/Loading</label> <input id="four" type="checkbox">
<div class="index_list">
<p>When working with <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i>, you should know
that each target platform has its own save area where files and
directories can be written to and read from. Below is a list of
those areas for each target when sandboxed:</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Windows</b> and <b>Windows UWP</b>- Windows has all files in
the <tt>%localappdata%\&lt;Game Name&gt;</tt> directory (on Windows
7 this is the <tt>/Users/&lt;User Name&gt;/AppData/Local/&lt;Game
Name&gt;</tt> directory).</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>HTML5</b> - Everything is done through the local
storage.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>macOS</b> - Storage will depend on whether the application
is sandboxed or not (following Apple's rules, with the path usually
being <tt>~/Library/Application Support/&lt;Game
Name&gt;</tt>).</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Ubuntu (Linux)</b> - Files are stored in the
<tt>Home/.config/gamename</tt> where "Home" is the users home
directory - <tt>/home/&lt;username&gt;</tt></li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>iOS</b> - Storage is the standard location (as viewed
through iTunes).</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>

<li><b>Android</b> - Files are in the standard location (which is
invisible unless the device is rooted) <tt>/data/&lt;package
name&gt;</tt>.</li>

<li style="list-style: none"><br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is worth noting that the <b>HTML5</b> target module has a
limit on local storage (which can be between 1MB and 5MB depending
on the browser) meaning that you will not be permitted to save
large sprites, screenshots etc...</p>
