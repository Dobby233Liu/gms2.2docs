<h2>In App Purchases</h2>

<div class="body-scroll">
<p><br>
</p>

<div class="note"><b>IMPORTANT!</b> The following section refers to
<b>deprecated functions that can no longer be used in your projects
on any platform</b>. For current In App Purchase functionality you
need to have installed the appropriate extension for the target
platform. The extensions all come with a <tt>*.pdf</tt> format
mini-manual explaining how to use them as well as showing all the
function definitions and examples and they link to the appropriate
setup guides on the Helpdesk. All references to the old
<tt>iap_*()</tt> functions will need to be replaced (and updated)
to use the extension equivalents. Using these functions will not
break your projects in-so-much as they won't crash, but they will
not work either and a message will be logged in the output.</div>

<p><br>
</p>

<p>In App Purchases are an important part of modern, cross platform
games, permitting you to have "freemium" content where your game is
free, but certain content is only available through a purchase from
within the game itself. For example, your puzzle game is free, but
the extra levels are going to cost the user 0.99$. This app model
is very common and can be set up with a minimum amount of work from
within <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> , and this section of the manual
has details of all the available functions that enable you to do
just that, as well as some advice for setting up and information on
how to test on the different platforms.</p>

<p>Setting up in app purchases within your game is relatively
simple with <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i>, but it still requires some
amount of knowledge of the target platform setup as well as careful
planning before starting to create your game, so it is not
recommended that you use this functionality if you are just
starting with <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> or if you are not sure how
the different stores for each target platform are set up.</p>

<p>Before doing anything else you will have to make sure that you
have set up the purchase details on the target store for each
platform that you wish to support, taking careful note of each of
the <b>Product IDs</b> that you define, as these ID strings are how
<i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> identifies each product and purchase.
Most of the stores will require you to have uploaded a base file
too, even if the game doesn't have in-app purchases included
yet.</p>

<div class="note"><b>NOTE</b>: <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> currently
permits up to 128 distinct purchase options per title, except if
you are using the Amazon Store (for Android) where it is limited to
100.</div>

<p><br>
Below are listed the functions that are integrated in <i>GameMaker
Studio 2</i> to enable in app purchases on the different target
platforms (these give the ability to buy extra credits, items,
levels and other things from within the game itself). Many of these
functions will trigger an <a href=
"../../../2_interface/1_editors/events/async_events.html">IAP
Asynchronous Event</a>, which contains a special <tt>ds_map</tt>
called <tt>iap_data</tt> which will have an initial key "type" that
can be queried to get the type of IAP event that has been
triggered:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="iap_data.html">iap_data</a><br>
</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
Once you know which type of IAP event it is, you can then get
further data from the map relevant to the event.</p>

<p>The available in app purchase functions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="iap_activate.html">iap_activate</a><br>
</li>

<li><a href="iap_status.html">iap_status</a><br>
</li>

<li><a href=
"iap_enumerate_products.html">iap_enumerate_products</a><br>
</li>

<li><a href="iap_restore_all.html">iap_restore_all</a><br>
</li>

<li><a href="iap_acquire.html">iap_acquire</a><br>
</li>

<li><a href="iap_consume.html">iap_consume</a><br>
</li>

<li><a href="iap_product_details.html">iap_product_details</a><br>
</li>

<li><a href=
"iap_purchase_details.html">iap_purchase_details</a><br>
</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>You should also be aware that <i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> does
<i><b>not</b></i> persist active purchase state across multiple
plays of the game (and thus <tt>iap_is_purchased()</tt> is
unreliable if a store has not successfully loaded). This means that
you will have to store this information yourself and retrieve it
again on each start-up of your game. You can use the special
"secure" save and load functions provided for ds_maps for this
purpose:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=
"../data_structures/ds%20maps/ds_map_secure_save.html">ds_map_secure_save</a><br>

</li>

<li><a href=
"../data_structures/ds%20maps/ds_map_secure_load.html">ds_map_secure_load</a><br>

</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p><i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> does not persist purchase state across
multiple plays of the game because it is not appropriate for us to
provide a secure method of verifying whether or not an individual
purchase is valid and therefore any automatically stored purchase
state would be presumptuous. On most platforms "receipt" data will
be available through <a href=
"iap_purchase_details.html"><tt>iap_purchase_details()</tt></a>
which users can use to verify a purchase, although Google Play uses
"token" data instead.</p>

<p><i>GameMaker Studio 2</i> requires the <b>Google Play Public
Key</b> for simple local purchase verification and you may check
that the "payload" data returned with a purchase result matches
that used with the matching call to <tt>iap_acquire()</tt> (see the
section on <b>Packaging</b> in the <a href=
"../../../2_interface/3_settings/game_options/options_android.html">
Android Game Options</a> for more information on the Google Public
Key) .</p>

<p>In-app purchases are available for Android, Amazon Fire, iOS and
macOS targets, and there are articles available on the YoYo Games
helpdesk (and a tutorial for Amazon Fire) to help you get each one
set up correctly:</p>
